# Integrated-Analysis---K-means-Clustering-using-Tableau-R
A hands-on experience K-means clustering analysis using R and visualizing results through Tableau.<br />
Below are the objectives of the exercise<br />
1) Data retrieval<br />
2) Data pre-processing<br />
This steps involves replacing missing value of the ages with their mean, adding age category column and replacing the label with a meaningful name<br />
4) K-means clustering <br />
a) Three important categorical variables in the titanic dataset are<br />
Survived,
Sex,
Embarked<br />
Create 3 new variables of type continuous and save them in the new file “titanicUpdated.csv”<br />
b) Normalize the data and find the total number of clusters required<br />
c)  Plot the two graphs <br />
6) Tableau- R integration by invoking Rserve ()<br />
Leverage the modeling power of R along with the visualization power of Tableau to perform our integrated analysis
